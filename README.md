# DrawMan

University WebDev project "DrawMan"

Inspire by the drawing game exquisite corpse where 3 players get to draw a head, body and legs which then gets mixed up and merged together at the end to create a full character. This is then combined with OpenAI to generate a name and backstory to the characters created by players.
